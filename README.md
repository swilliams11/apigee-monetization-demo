# apigee-monetization-demo

This repository walks through some basic use cases of how to configure Monetization on Edge as well as on the Drupal Developer Portal.  I will only describe the default behavior without any customization.   


## Terms and Conditions
If an administrator adds a new terms and conditions to the Organization's profile (Edge -> Admin > Organization Profile), then the developer must accept the new terms and conditions before they purchase a new rate plan.  

### Adding new terms and conditions

However, a developer can continue to use the plans they purchased previously without interruption, even if they don't accept the new terms and conditions.
